    <h1>About:</h1>
    <p><b>Woodsboro, California, September 25, 1996. Casey Becker, while waiting for the arrival of her boyfriend Steve Orth at home, receives a phone call from what will turn out to be a crazy psychopath. Forced to take part in a sick game in which she will have to correctly answer some questions about horror movies to save her life and that of Steve, held prisoner outside the house, Casey fails, so first Steve, then she are brutally murdered by the maniac, disguised with a long black cape and a ghost mask reminiscent of Edvard Munch's The Scream (from which it takes the name of Ghostface).</b></p>
