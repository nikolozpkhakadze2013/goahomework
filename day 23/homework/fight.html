    <h1><b>About:</b></h1>
    <p><b>The protagonist is a young man whose real name is never explicitly mentioned. He works as an insurance consultant in one of the major car manufacturers. This is the stereotype of the average citizen: frustrated by work, a slave to consumerism, depressed, sleepless, anxious and stunned by jet lag. His only form of happiness and leisure is to furnish his apartment, in which he lives alone. The man finds an apparent cure for his problems by starting to attend, lying about his real health conditions, listening groups for people suffering from incurable diseases; in this way he also meets Marla Singer, a depressed young woman who, like him, pretends to have serious illnesses in order to attend groups. Since the man cannot be calm knowing that he has another liar in the same groups as him, he proposes that they divide the dating every other week, and the two exchange phone numbers.</b></p>
