    <h2 id="About"><b>Example of album</b></h2>
    <p>An album is a collection of audio recordings issued on a physical medium such as compact disc (CD), vinyl, audio tape, or digital distribution. It is usually associated with a single artist or band, and is usually composed of several tracks. Albums typically contain between 10 and 12 songs, with some albums having as many as 18 tracks. They are typically designed to be listened to as a complete body of work. Albums are typically collections of songs that are from one artist. </p>

    <p>The album title was discovered on August 18, 2018, when a recording of Carti surfaced, in which he was conversing about the project. The title refers to Carti’s affiliation with the Bloods, as well as his affinity for Wockhardt ’s red codeine-promethazine syrup, commonly used in lean.</p>
