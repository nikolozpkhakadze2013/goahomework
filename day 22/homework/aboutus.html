    <h2>How everything started</h2>
    <p>i was 11 years old when i had an idea that i wanted to resell unused products,i went in the neighbourhood and knocked on everyones door and asked if they had any unused shoes,shirts or pants and i bought them for fair price and reselled it for double the price i was making profit can you imagine 11 year old doing that? no right? me neither then i wanted to go global and asked my friend who was a programmer at that time to build me a web site he charged me 200$ for a site that was sooooo bad haha but hey you got to start somewhere right? first week went by no notifications on the phone i was sad i waited for 2 weeks for just 1 notification from a web site oh yea by the way if you have a product that you dont need and you dont use <a href="contact.html">contact us <i>here</i></a> ok now lets get back in to the story i got a notification from a web site that my product was sold it was nike air jordan 1 that i bought from my neighbours cousin for 30$ i sold it for 80$ huge profit with that 80$ i went and bought one air jordan and one air force and thats how it all started now i own a large company and i make 15k$ a month</p>
